        <h3>My passions:</h3>
            <p class="important">I have passions of working out at the gym and pushing
            my mind and my body beyond it's limits, that is why I have decided to partake in competitions as a natural bodybuilder; other passions
            of mine would be to help spread the word of God as much as I possibly can, as I am a devoted man of God and hopefully becoming as
            successful as I can due to principles that was instilled within me, by my loving parents and God. </p>
<br>
        <h3>What motivates me:</h3>
            <p class="important">I personally don't believe that motivation is a driving factor for me, as I believe that motivation is nothing compared to
            dedication; and dedication is something that was instilled in me, which cannot be taken away from me, and I know that when I put
            my mind to something there is no one that is going to stop me.</p>
<br>
        <h3>What I would like to do most</h3>
            <p class="important">What I would like to most in life is to live a fruitful and joyful life, by becoming successful through God's plan and to make
            my parents proud, I personally believe that I have the best parents on the planet, and nothing would make me happier than to show
            them who they raised and make them proud. </p>
